# Smuggler

> "Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money." - Han Solo

Smuggle data between SQLite and Cloudflare D1. Fast. Stateless. Questionable life choices.

## Status: Alpha (Han Solo Approved)

We use this in production at [huttspawn.com](https://huttspawn.com). It works. Mostly.

Should *you* use it? That depends. Do you:
- Read the manual before assembling furniture? **Maybe wait for 1.0**
- Shoot first? **Welcome aboard**

There are [known issues](https://github.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/issues). We're shaving parsecs, not days.

## What It Does

D1 is SQLite at the edge, but Cloudflare doesn't give you a way to sync your local dev database with production. Smuggler fills that gap:

- **Content hashing** - Compares actual row data, not just timestamps
- **Delta sync** - Only moves rows that changed
- **Bidirectional** - Push to D1, pull from D1, or both
- **No state files** - Fresh comparison every run, no stale state to haunt you

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/main/install.sh | bash
```

Detects your platform, downloads the right binary, verifies the checksum, and installs to `~/.local/bin/`. Supports Linux x64, macOS x64, and macOS ARM64.

Install a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/main/install.sh | bash -s v0.1.0
```

### Manual download

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Linux x64 | [smuggler-linux-x64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/releases/latest/download/smuggler-linux-x64.tar.gz) |
| macOS x64 | [smuggler-macos-x64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/releases/latest/download/smuggler-macos-x64.tar.gz) |
| macOS ARM64 | [smuggler-macos-arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/ezmode-games/smuggler/releases/latest/download/smuggler-macos-arm64.tar.gz) |

### From source

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/ezmode-games/smuggler
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy the example config:

```bash
cp config.example.toml config.toml
```

2. Add your credentials (don't commit this file, genius):

```toml
cloudflare_account_id = "your-account-id"
cloudflare_api_token = "your-api-token"
database_id = "your-d1-database-id"
local_db = ".wrangler/state/v3/d1/miniflare-D1DatabaseObject/xxx.sqlite"
```

3. Check if you can reach D1:

```bash
smuggler status
```

4. See what's different:

```bash
smuggler diff
```

5. Push your local changes (point of no return):

```bash
smuggler push
```

## Commands

```
smuggler status    # Can we phone home?
smuggler diff      # What's different?
smuggler push      # Local -> D1 (YOLO)
smuggler pull      # D1 -> Local (safer YOLO)
```

### Options

```
-c, --config <FILE>   Config file [default: config.toml]
-v, --verbose         See what's happening under the hood
--dry-run             Coward mode (just kidding, it's smart)
--table <NAME>        Sync one table only (validated against schema)
```

## How It Works

For each table, Smuggler:

1. Grabs all primary keys from both databases
2. SHA256 hashes each row's content (minus timestamp columns)
3. Compares timestamps when available
4. Sorts rows into buckets:

| Bucket | What it means | Push | Pull |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| `local_only` | You added it locally | Insert to D1 | - |
| `remote_only` | Someone else added it | - | Insert locally |
| `local_newer` | Your timestamp wins | Update D1 | - |
| `remote_newer` | Their timestamp wins | - | Update local |
| `content_differs` | Same timestamp, different data | Configurable | Configurable |
| `identical` | Exactly the same | Skip | Skip |

### Why content hashing?

Timestamps lie. Clocks drift. Bulk imports set everything to "now". Content hashing catches actual changes regardless of what the timestamps say.

## Configuration

```toml
cloudflare_account_id = "abc123"
cloudflare_api_token = "your-token-with-d1-permissions"
database_id = "your-d1-uuid"
local_db = "/path/to/local.sqlite"

[sync]
# Empty = sync all tables except excluded
tables = []

# Things you definitely don't want to sync
exclude_tables = [
    "sqlite_sequence",
    "_cf_KV",
    "__drizzle_migrations",
]

# Column for timestamp-based detection (falls back to content hash)
timestamp_column = "updated_at"

# When both sides changed: "local_wins", "remote_wins", "newer_wins"
conflict_resolution = "local_wins"
```

### Finding Your Local D1 Database

Wrangler hides it at:

```
.wrangler/state/v3/d1/miniflare-D1DatabaseObject/<hash>.sqlite
```

The hash is derived from your binding name. If you have multiple databases, may the Force be with you.

### API Token

Get one from [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens):

- D1:Read - for `diff`, `pull`, `status`
- D1:Write - for `push`

Pro tip: Create one token with both permissions. Fewer tokens to lose.

## Limitations

Things we don't do:

- **Schema sync** - Run your migrations separately, we're data movers not DDL runners
- **Transactions** - Each batch is atomic, but the whole sync isn't. Re-run if interrupted.
- **BLOB wizardry** - Binary data compared as hex strings. It works but it's not pretty.
- **Tables without primary keys** - We need something to compare. Add a PK.

## Troubleshooting

### "401 Unauthorized"
Your token is expired or wrong. Make a new one.

### "Invalid table name"
Smuggler validates `--table` input against your database schema before touching any SQL. If the table doesn't exist, you'll get a list of available tables. Run your migrations on both databases first. We don't create tables.

### All rows show as "content_differs"
Check that column order and types match. NULL vs empty string will cause hash mismatches.

### It's slow
Large syncs take time. Check the GitHub issues for performance improvements in progress.

## Development

```bash
cargo test                       # Run the tests
cargo fmt                        # Format code
cargo clippy --all-targets       # Lint (including tests)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- diff # Debug output
```
