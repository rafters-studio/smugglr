//! Masterless multicast gossip sync -- the LAN broadcast shape.
//!
//! Spec (`vault/site/homepage.md` -> "LAN broadcast semantics"):
//!
//! - **Masterless / peer-symmetric.** Every node runs the identical loop; there
//!   is no coordinator and no client/server distinction.
//! - **Membership = key possession.** All datagrams are XChaCha20-Poly1305
//!   sealed with a shared key (see [`crate::broadcast::maybe_encrypt`]); holding
//!   the key is the only access control. There is no path-, filename-, or
//!   DB-identity scoping: two replicas of one logical database sync regardless of
//!   where each stores its file. Isolate clusters on one LAN with distinct keys
//!   (a foreign key's datagrams fail AEAD authentication and are dropped).
//!
//!   That mechanism requires a key. A node configured *without* one decrypts
//!   nothing and verifies nothing -- it hands every datagram to the `Msg` parser,
//!   which rejects a foreign cluster's ciphertext as unparseable. The datagram is
//!   still dropped, but by a parse failure rather than an authentication check,
//!   so a keyless node has no cluster isolation in the security sense and no
//!   integrity guarantee on what it does accept: any host on the subnet can
//!   originate rows for it. Run with a key (#313).
//! - **Idempotent apply under a declared policy.** An incoming row is applied
//!   with a single guarded statement, so applying the same row twice is a no-op
//!   and lost datagrams are safe. Which side wins a same-PK collision is
//!   [`BroadcastConfig::conflict_resolution`], which defaults to `remote_wins`
//!   -- the historical last-received-wins behavior, unchanged. `newer_wins`
//!   orders by `max` across
//!   [`BroadcastConfig::ordering_columns`](crate::broadcast::BroadcastConfig::ordering_columns)
//!   and is an explicit opt-in; the comparison rides inside the write
//!   (`ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE ... WHERE`), so it is atomic against a
//!   concurrent local write rather than a read-then-write race.
//!
//!   Both peers must opt in. A mesh where one node runs `newer_wins` and
//!   another `remote_wins` converges toward the permissive node -- the policy
//!   is apply-side, so it is not negotiated on the wire and
//!   [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`](crate::broadcast::PROTOCOL_VERSION) is unaffected.
//! - **Heartbeat reconciliation.** Each node periodically multicasts a
//!   `primary_key -> content_hash` [`Digest`](Body::Digest) for every syncable
//!   table. A peer that hears a digest covering rows it lacks (or hashes
//!   differently) multicasts a [`Want`](Body::Want); whoever holds those rows
//!   answers with a [`Delta`](Body::Delta). Late joiners and partition rejoins
//!   converge through the same path with no special case.
//!
//! ## v0.1 boundaries (named, per the smugglr conflict doctrine -- do not hide)
//!
//! - **Concurrent same-PK divergence resolves without a causal record** (no
//!   vector clocks/CRDTs). Under the default `remote_wins` it resolves silently;
//!   under `newer_wins` the loser is counted in
//!   [`GossipEvent::Applied::rejected`] and per-table anomalies are readable via
//!   [`Gossip::ordering_notes`]. Two writes at the identical instant still tie,
//!   and a tie is not accepted -- the two nodes stay divergent and re-exchange
//!   on each heartbeat. UUIDv7 PKs make this rare; the single-writer-per-row
//!   workload makes it rarer. Visible-conflict / strict-replay is v0.2.
//! - **Deletes do not propagate at all** (#311). Not by the heartbeat, and not by
//!   the live [`Delta`](Body::Delta) either: through 0.4.x that packet's `deletes`
//!   list was populated and put on the wire, but no receiver ever applied it, so
//!   the live path documented here as the one that worked never did.
//!   [`Gossip::broadcast_delta`] no longer accepts deletes, and the receive side
//!   drops any a 0.4.x peer still sends. The heartbeat cannot substitute: it
//!   advertises *presence*, so an absent PK is indistinguishable from
//!   not-yet-received -- the digest reconciles upserts/divergence, not deletions.
//!   Tombstone propagation is v0.2; until then, model deletion as a `deleted_at`
//!   column and let it ride the upsert path.
//! - **Schema is the user's.** smugglr syncs rows, never DDL; a row for a table
//!   that does not exist locally is dropped with a warning.
