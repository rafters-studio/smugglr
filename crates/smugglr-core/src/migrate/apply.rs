//! Forward apply engine (#273).
//!
//! Applies a manifest's forward [`Op`]s to a **local** SQLite target,
//! idempotently and **per-op**. Composition -- lint, pre-image capture, ledger
//! recording -- lives in the driver (#296), never here: this module imports no
//! ledger and touches no config/target resolution. The public primitive is
//! [`apply_ops`], which the driver (#296) and the surgical log (#289) drive
//! through a per-op `pre_op` write-ahead hook.
//!
//! # Two compilation surfaces
//!
//! `migrate::mod` declares `pub mod apply;` with **no** `native` gate, so this
//! file compiles on `wasm32`. Everything that touches `rusqlite` (the local
//! execution path: [`apply_ops`] and its helpers) is therefore internally
//! `#[cfg(feature = "native")]`. The pure statement *generators* for remote
//! targets ([`d1_statements`], [`turso_statements`], [`rqlite_statements`]) and
//! the shared SQL string builders are always compiled -- they are `String`
//! producers with no database handle.
//!
//! # Idempotency is per-op, not blanket (decision 6, spikes A/I/J)
//!
//! There is no single "apply is idempotent" property. Each op earns it:
//! - `CREATE TABLE` / `CREATE INDEX` use `IF NOT EXISTS`.
//! - `ADD COLUMN` has no `IF NOT EXISTS`; it is guarded by a raw
//!   `PRAGMA table_info` precheck (and treats a "duplicate column name" error as
//!   success), because reusing `local::table_info_inner` would wrongly error on
//!   an absent or PK-less table.
//! - `DROP COLUMN` cannot `ALTER`-drop an indexed / `UNIQUE` / `PRIMARY KEY`
//!   column; it drops referencing explicit indexes first, and falls back to a
//!   guarded 12-step table rebuild for the columns SQLite still refuses.
//! - `RENAME TABLE` / `RENAME COLUMN` have no `IF EXISTS`; they are guarded by an
//!   existence precheck so a re-run is a no-op.
//!
//! # Transactions and the foreign-keys pragma
//!
//! `apply_ops` takes a `&rusqlite::Connection` (never a pre-opened
//! `Transaction`) and opens its **own** transaction *per op*. This is load
//! bearing: `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is silently a no-op while a transaction is
//! open, and the 12-step rebuild of a **referenced** table (spike K) must run
//! with foreign-key enforcement off. The rebuild therefore toggles the pragma
//! *outside* any transaction -- `foreign_keys=OFF` (autocommit) -> `BEGIN` ->
//! rebuild + `sqlite_sequence` preserve -> `foreign_key_check` /
//! `integrity_check` -> `COMMIT` -> restore the caller's prior `foreign_keys`
//! state -- and simple ops each get their own short transaction.
//!
//! # Rebuild reconstruction is faithful for keys, warned-on for the rest
//!
//! The `DROP COLUMN` rebuild reconstructs the surviving schema from
//! `PRAGMA table_info` / `foreign_key_list` plus the original
//! `sqlite_master.sql`, which recovers column types, `NOT NULL`, defaults, the
//! primary key (single-column rowid-alias **and** composite), foreign keys
//! (**including composite**) with their `ON DELETE` / `ON UPDATE` referential
//! actions, `AUTOINCREMENT`, and **generated columns** with their expressions
//! and storage classes. It still **cannot** recover `CHECK` constraints,
//! table-level / surviving-column `UNIQUE`, column `COLLATE`, or
//! `WITHOUT ROWID`. Rather than drop those silently, the rebuild emits a
//! `tracing::warn!` when the table being rebuilt carries such constructs, so
//! the loss is visible.
//!
//! **Generated columns** took three passes and the sequence explains the shape
//! of the code. `table_info` -- the pragma the whole reconstruction introspects
//! with -- omits them entirely, so they were never in the set of columns to
//! rebuild *and never in the set of constructs to warn about*: the loss was
//! total and silent (#342). They are found through `PRAGMA table_xinfo`, which
//! reports them with `hidden` `2` (`VIRTUAL`) or `3` (`STORED`), and that made
//! the loss loud. It did nothing for recovery, because the generation
//! *expression* is in no pragma at all.
//!
//! Recovery therefore reads `sqlite_master.sql` and takes the column's whole
//! declaration verbatim (#387), which brings the expression and anything else
//! declared alongside it. That is a text split rather than a pragma read, so it
//! is the one recovery here that can be *uncertain* -- and an uncertain one
//! falls back to the warn-and-drop above rather than emitting a guess, for all
//! of a table's generated columns or none. A wrong expression produces a table
//! that is broken rather than merely diminished.
//!
//! Two things a foreign key can carry are **not** recovered, and they are named
//! rather than left to the word "foreign keys" to imply. `MATCH` is absent from
//! `foreign_key_list` entirely -- the pragma reports `NONE` even for a key
//! declared `MATCH FULL` -- so it joins the warned-loss list above; SQLite
//! parses `MATCH` and ignores it, so what is lost is declared text and not
//! behaviour. `DEFERRABLE` / `INITIALLY DEFERRED` has no pragma column at all
//! and is not warned about, so a rebuild silently makes a deferred constraint
//! immediate. That is the shape of #341 still open on a narrower construct, and
//! stating it here is the point: the sentence above used to claim foreign keys
//! were recovered while their actions were being dropped, and the fix for that
//! is not to write a slightly wider claim. A rebuild driven by an
//! *explicit* target schema (as reverse #274 / convert #280 will pass) does not
//! have this gap.
//!
//! Explicit indexes and **triggers** are not in that list: the swap's
//! `DROP TABLE` destroys both, and the rebuild replays their verbatim
//! `sqlite_master` DDL afterwards (#336). The one exception is a trigger whose
//! body mentions the dropped column -- SQLite would accept the `CREATE TRIGGER`
//! and then fail every later write to the table -- so that trigger joins the
//! warned-loss list instead of being replayed.
