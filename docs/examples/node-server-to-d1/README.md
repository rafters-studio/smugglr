# node-server-to-d1

A Node script reads a local SQLite database and pushes its rows to an HTTP-SQL endpoint with the `smugglr` npm package. No CLI is involved; the sync engine runs in-process as WebAssembly. The production destination is Cloudflare D1. The output below was captured against `local-endpoint.mjs`, a 50-line stand-in for D1 that ships with this example, because a D1 run needs an account and an API token this repository does not have. The data is the shared [westwind](../westwind/) sample: eight tables, 1,196 rows.

## Prerequisites

Node 24 (the capture ran on 24.12.0; the scripts use `--env-file` and `import.meta.resolve`, and the local endpoint uses `node:sqlite`), pnpm, the `sqlite3` shell, and a `smugglr` binary for `../westwind/make.sh` (on your PATH, or named in `SMUGGLR`). For the D1 variant, a D1 database and an API token with `D1:Edit` scope from <https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens>.

## Setup

Install the dependencies. pnpm 10 and later refuse to run a dependency's build script until you approve it, and `better-sqlite3` needs its script to fetch a prebuilt binary.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm approve-builds better-sqlite3
cp .env.example .env
```

Build the two databases. smugglr moves rows, not DDL, so the schema has to exist on both sides first; `--empty` applies it and skips the seed.

```sh
SMUGGLR=/path/to/smugglr ../westwind/make.sh ./app.sqlite
SMUGGLR=/path/to/smugglr ../westwind/make.sh --empty ./remote.sqlite
```

Start the endpoint in a second terminal. It answers `POST {sql, params}` with `{columns, rows}`, which is the request and response shape of smugglr's `generic` profile, and keeps its rows in `remote.sqlite`.

```sh
node local-endpoint.mjs
```

```
(node:31480) ExperimentalWarning: SQLite is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
http-sql endpoint on http://127.0.0.1:8765 (db: ./remote.sqlite)
```

## Run

```sh
node --env-file=.env push.mjs
```

```
loaded smugglr wasm: 316800 bytes
push complete: {"command":"push","status":"ok","tables":[{"name":"categories","rowsPushed":8},{"name":"customers","rowsPushed":40},{"name":"employees","rowsPushed":9},{"name":"order_details","rowsPushed":788},{"name":"orders","rowsPushed":320},{"name":"products","rowsPushed":20},{"name":"shippers","rowsPushed":3},{"name":"suppliers","rowsPushed":8}]}
```

A second run pushes nothing, because every row's content hash already matches. A table with no rows moved omits its `rowsPushed` key.

```sh
node --env-file=.env push.mjs
```

```
loaded smugglr wasm: 316800 bytes
push complete: {"command":"push","status":"ok","tables":[{"name":"categories"},{"name":"customers"},{"name":"employees"},{"name":"order_details"},{"name":"orders"},{"name":"products"},{"name":"shippers"},{"name":"suppliers"}]}
```

## Pushing to D1

Uncomment the three D1 lines in `.env` and fill in the account id, database id, and token; the script is unchanged. The URL is the D1 query endpoint, `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account-id>/d1/database/<database-id>/query`, and `DEST_PROFILE=d1` selects D1's request and response shape. D1 needs the same eight tables first. The CLI's own D1 path cannot apply the Westwind manifests there in 0.5.0 (#429), so export the schema from the local file and load it with wrangler: `sqlite3 app.sqlite .schema > schema.sql`, then `pnpm dlx wrangler d1 execute <name> --remote --file=schema.sql`. This path was not run here; it needs a D1 token.

## What this demonstrates

The `smugglr` package runs in Node with the same WebAssembly binary the browser gets. The binary is 316,800 bytes on disk in 0.5.0 and 126,497 bytes gzipped. One thing differs from the browser: the wasm-bindgen loader fetches the binary relative to its glue module, and Node's `fetch` has no `file:` scheme, so a bare `Smugglr.init()` fails with `fetch failed`. The script reads the bytes itself, hands them to the glue module's initializer, then registers the module with `setWasm` before the first `init()`.

A `LocalEndpointConfig` with a custom `SqlExecutor` plugs any SQLite runtime into the local side. The executor here wraps `better-sqlite3` in ten lines: bind `params` positionally, and answer with `{columns, rows}` where each row is an array in column order. The same shape works for sql.js, the official sqlite-wasm package, or your own.

The destination is only an HTTP endpoint that speaks SQL. `local-endpoint.mjs` and D1 are interchangeable from the script's point of view; only the URL, the token, and the profile name change.

Table selection is the intersection of both sides' table lists, minus `excludeTables`, minus any table without a primary key, in alphabetical order. That order is not configurable, which is why Westwind declares no foreign keys (see its README). The `_smugglr_migrations` ledger that `make.sh` leaves behind has no primary key and is skipped on that ground alone; the script lists it in `excludeTables` anyway, because setting that option replaces the package's default list rather than adding to it.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `push.mjs` | The example. Loads the WASM, wraps `better-sqlite3`, calls `push()` once. |
| `local-endpoint.mjs` | The `generic`-profile HTTP-SQL endpoint the capture ran against. `POST /fail/<n>` makes the next `n` queries answer 503; [node-auto-sync](../node-auto-sync/) uses that. |
| `.env.example` | Local endpoint values, with the D1 variant commented out. |
